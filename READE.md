# Zelda 2 Randomizer JS

## What is it?

A randomization library that can be used for randomizing legally owned Zelda 2 ROM's.

## What is it currently?

A parser for the Zelda 2 ROM so far.  Currently I have only implemented parsing the positions of overworld elements.

## What will it be?

Eventually I hope to match the randomization function of the existing Z2 Randomizer by digishake with support for deterministic, reproducible seeds using the same flags and values.
